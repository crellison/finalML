Download dataset on [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/painter-by-numbers/data).

TODO
- [x] func to get training data
- [x] plan for convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture
- [x] initial test results from subset of training data
- [ ] run it on the GPU for a benchmark
- [ ] figure out what is actually going on
